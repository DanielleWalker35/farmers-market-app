# Farmer's Market Finder

Allows you to find the nearest farmer's market in the United States to your current location

- Enter your zip code and get a list of farmer's markets.
- Click on the market and get more info.
- Provides a link to google maps to click for directions

- You can save the farmer's markets you like - there is no database so it will not remain after you navigate away from the app but I wiould like to add that in the future.

### Technologies Used 
React, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Redux + Thunk

### Lessons Learned: 
- Understanding the best way to interact with databases to get the infromation that you want. All databases are not designed in a way that it is easy to get the data you need. 
- You need a good understanding of how the data is arranged so you can get to the data you are looking for.

### Future Development Plans 
Add user authenticaiton so that you can save markets after refreshing the application
